        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I like to work with small businesses and nonprofits to help make affordable, high-quality digital tools. I can help you with all sorts of things: websites, web apps, mobile applications, and UX design. More importantly, though, I enjoy being a digital consultant: I'll work with you to solve your real-world problems using digital tools. I believe in using my skills to make it easier (and less expensive) for small companies to take advantage of the web.</p>

        <p>Full-time, I'm an Assistant Professor of Digital Media and Design at the University of Connecticut. There, I teach Web Design, Web Development, and User Experience Design. This lets me stay on top of all the latest and greatest techniques in the digital world. In my role at UConn, I also get to work on mobile apps, websites, and other digital projects for some great partners.</p>

        <p>I often do freelance/contract web development.</p>

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>I enjoy working as a freelance web developer. I can help you with things like WordPress (and other CMS) development, landing page development and SEO, custom web apps (PHP/Laravel/Node, *SQL), Javascript apps (Angular, React, Vue, etc), and pretty much anything in the web development realm. </p>

          <h3>UX and Digital Consulting</h3>
          <p>My main area of research is in User Experience Design. I can come and talk to your company about the importance of UX, help you measure and evaluate your digital efforts, or work with you to develop a social media/digital strategy.
